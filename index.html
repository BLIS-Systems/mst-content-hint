      This specification extends MediaStreamTrack as defined in
      [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] to provide an media-content-type hint attribute. This
      optional hint permits <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> consumers such as
      <code>PeerConnection</code> or <code>MediaRecorder</code> to encode or
      process contained media with methods more appropriate to the type of
      content that is being consumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding a media-content-type hint provides a way for an application to help
      track consumers make more informed decision of what encoder parameters and
      processing algorithms to use on the consumed content.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Algorithms used for processing speech and music differ greatly.
      Echo-cancellation algorithms developed for speech-type content might not
      work well on music, and noise-suppression algorithms might remove drum
      snares or other "noisy" content. While this makes speech more intelligible
      it is less appropriate for music signals.
    </p>
    <p>
      For video, webcam content often require denoising and is often
      intelligible even when downscaled or with high quantization levels.
      Screencast content of presentations or webpages with a lot of text content
      is completely unintelligible if the quantization levels are too high or
      if the content is downscaled or otherwise blurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without automatic detection of media content, a
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> consumer can only make an educated guess.
      This guess may be based on assuming that screencast content (such as
      chrome.desktopCapture) contains text content and must use low quantization
      levels, and drop frames extensively to meet bitrate requirements. Another
      assumption is that regular USB video devices provide webcam video, and
      higher quantization levels and downscaling are acceptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      While usually appropriate this educated guess leads to sub-optimal
      settings when incorrect. This manifests as high framedropping when
      screencasting fluid content such as a movie or streaming a video game and
      treating it as text. Treating highly-detailed content as regular webcam
      video on the other hand leads to too-blurry content when being either
      quantized or downscaled beyond readability to meet bitrate requirements.
      This mismatch may happen when HDMI video-capture cards are believed to be
      USB webcams but actually screencast webpage text.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases the web application can make a more-educated guess or take
      user input to inform consumers of what kind of content is being encoded. A
      web application that streams video-game content would be able to preserve
      fluid motion from desktop capture at the cost of individual frame detail.
      A music-studio application would be able to prevent noise suppression from
      removing snares from a music track.
    </p>
    <p>
      These settings are not intended to replace encoder-level settings
      completely but rather complement them with a simpler hint that does not
      require broad knowledge of video encoders, audio-processing steps or
      more extensive tuning.

    <h2>Extension to MediaStreamTrack</h2>
    <pre class="idl">
    partial interface <span class="idlInterfaceID">MediaStreamTrack</span> {
      attribute DOMString contentTypeHint;
    };
    </pre>
    <p>
      Each <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> has an associated <dfn>application-set
      content-type hint</dfn>, initially <code>""</code>, signifying unset.
      This corresponds to the <dfn>contentTypeHint</dfn> attribute which may be
      used from the application to provide a hint of what type of content is
      contained within the track, to guide how it should be treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      On setting <code>contentTypeHint</code>, valid values are <code>""</code>
      and the values defined by the enumeration defined below corresponding to
      the track <code>kind</code>. <code>AudioContentTypeHint</code> and
      <code>VideoContentTypeHint</code> shall be used for <code>"audio"</code>
      and <code>"video"</code> <code>kind</code>s respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Setting of an invalid value shall be ignored as if the attribute were an
      enumeration containing only the valid values as defined above. On setting
      a valid value the implementation shall adapt its decision on how to handle
      the content type described by the new value. Descriptions and example
      behaviors for defined values specific to the track <code>kind</code> are
      listed below, but how to handle the hint, is entirely up to the
      implementation. The implementation may also use additional information,
      such as the track source, to determine how it should be treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>contentTypeHint</code> attribute, on getting, must return the
      last successfully set string, if any, corresponding to the
      currently-active hint, if any. If not previously set, or unset, the getter
      must return <code>""</code>, corresponding to that no hint is currently
      provided.
    </p>
    <table class="simple"><tbody><tr><th colspan="2">Enumeration description</th></tr>
      <tr><td><code>""</code></td><td><p>
        No hint has been provided, the implementation should make its
        best-informed guess on how contained content should be treated. This can
        for example be inferred from how the track was opened or by doing
        content analysis. This behavior is not restricted to behaviors
        corresponding to the standard enumerations corresponding to the track
        <code>kind</code>.
      </p></td></tr>
    </tbody></table>
    <h3>Audio content types</h3>
    <pre class="idl">
    enum AudioContentTypeHint {
      "speech",
      "music"
    };
    </pre>
    <p>
      Audio content types are only applicable when
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>'s <code>kind</code> attribute is set to
      <code>"audio"</code> and contains an audio track.
      <code>contentTypeHint</code> should only accept values defined within
      <code>AudioContentTypeHint</code> when being applied to an audio track.
    </p>
    <table class="simple"><tbody><tr><th colspan="2">Enumeration description</th></tr>
      <tr><td><code id="idl-def-AudioContentTypeHint.speech">speech</code></td><td><p>
        The track should be treated as if it contains speech data. Consuming
        this signal it may be appropriate to apply noise suppression or boosting
        the intelligibility of the incoming signal.
      </p></td></tr>
      <tr><td><code id="idl-def-AudioContentTypeHint.music">music</code></td><td><p>
        The track should be treated as if it contains music data. Generally this
        might imply tuning or turning off audio-processing components that are
        used to process speech data to prevent the audio from being distorted.
      </p></td></tr>
    </tbody></table>
    <h3>Video content types</h3>
    <pre class="idl">
    enum VideoContentTypeHint {
      "fluid",
      "detailed"
    };
    </pre>
    <p>
      Video content types are only applicable when
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>'s <code>kind</code> attribute is set to
      <code>"video"</code> and contains a video track.
      <code>contentTypeHint</code> should only accept values defined within
      <code>VideoContentTypeHint</code> when being applied to a video track.
    </p>
    <table class="simple"><tbody><tr><th colspan="2">Enumeration description</th></tr>
      <tr><td><code id="idl-def-VideoContentTypeHint.fluid">fluid</code></td><td><p>
        The track should be treated as if it contains fluid video. This is
        normally webcam video, movies or video games. Quantization artefacts and
        downscaling is acceptible to preserve fluid motion while retaining
        bitrates. During low bitrates when compromises have to be made, less
        effort is spent on preserving edge quality and detail.
      </p></td></tr>
      <tr><td><code id="idl-def-VideoContentTypeHint.detail">detailed</code></td><td><p>
        The track should be treated as if video details are extra important.
        This is generally applicable to presentations or web pages with text
        content, painting or line art. This setting would normally optimize for
        detail in the resulting individual frames rather than smooth playback.
        Quantization artefacts or downscaling that make small text or line art
        unintelligible should be avoided.
